## React JS

### What is React JS?
- React JS, commonly referred to as React, is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs).
- React is a declarative, component-based library that
allows developers to build reusable UI components.

### Key Features of React

- #### Component-Based Architecture
    - React enables developers to break down the UI
    into smaller, self-contained components

- #### JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension)
    - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript files. This makes React components more readable and expressive. For example:
``const name = "GeekforGeeks";``
``const element = <h1>Welcome to {name}</h1>;``
    - JSX is not mandatory but is highly recommended for its readability and ease of use

- #### Virtual DOM
    - React maintains a lightweight representation of the actual DOM in memory. When changes occur, React efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the DOM, improving performance

- #### One-Way Data Binding
    - React follows a one-way data binding approach, where data flows from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to understand and debug the application

- #### Performance
    - React's use of the virtual DOM and efficient updating mechanisms make it a fast and performant library for building UIs

- #### Single-Page Applications (SPAs)
    - React is often used to create SPAs, which allow for smooth content updates without page reloads. This is ideal for real-time applications

### How React Works
- React operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than directly manipulating the browserâ€™s DOM. It performs necessary manipulations within this virtual representation before applying changes to the actual browser DOM. This approach minimizes DOM updates and enhances performance

### How to Install React
**Step 1**: Install Node.js
1. To install Node, visit the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2, Once installation is complete, open your command prompt to confirm that Node has been successfully installed. Type in `node - v` in your command prompt, then enter. Move to the step 2 if the Node version is displayed in the command prompt.

**Step 2**: Install React
**Using CRA (Traditional)**
1. type `cd [directory name]` then enter.
2. In the documents directory (or wherever you're creating your project), create a folder that you will be using to create your React app. Type `mkdir [folder name]`then navigate to the newly created directory using cd [newly created folder name].
3. In the newly created folder directory, type in `npx create-react-app [project name of your choice]`, and then wait until your React project is completely created. 
4. Lastly, open the React project in your code editor by typing in `code .`. 

**Using Vite (Modern)**
1. Make sure the Node is installed.
2. Navigate to the directory you want to use and create a new folder.
3. Open the terminal (located in between Run and Help), then run `npm create vite@latest[your project name]`.
4. *Select Framework* - use cursor to navigate to where we have React,then enter.
5. *Select Language* - choose JavaScript
6. Navigate the project directory where you created the React project. Type `cd [directory name].
7. Install the Node module folder by typing `npm install`in the terminal. Once it is done, you should see the folder at the top.
8. Type `npm run dev`to run your project and display on the web page.
